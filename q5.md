# Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')


# Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')


# Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')



1. Functionality of Each Approach:

# Approach 1 (doubleL(n)):------------------------

Creates a list res to store the doubled values.
Iterates from 0 to n-1 using a for loop.
Appends i * 2 (twice the current value) to the res list for each iteration.
Returns the res list containing the doubled values.


# Approach 2 (List Comprehension):--------------------
Uses a list comprehension to create a list of doubled values in one line.
Iterates from 0 to n-1 using a for loop.
For each iteration, it generates the expression n * 2 (twice the current value) and adds it to the list.
The resulting list is implicitly assigned to the variable x and printed.

# Approach 3 (doubleG(n)):-----------------------
Defines a generator function doubleG(n) that yields doubled values on demand.
Iterates from 0 to n-1 using a for loop.
Yields i * 2 (twice the current value) using the yield keyword, making the function lazy.
When iterating over doubleG(n) using a for loop, the yielded values are retrieved one by one.

2. Function Type and Advantages of doubleG(n):

doubleG(n) is a generator function. It differs from regular functions in the way it returns values:
Regular functions return all values at once upon completion.
Generator functions return values lazily, one by one (on demand), using the yield keyword.

# Advantages of using doubleG(n):--------------

Memory efficiency: When dealing with large datasets, a generator can save memory by producing values only as needed, rather than creating a whole list upfront.
Efficiency for infinite sequences: If you're dealing with an infinite sequence (e.g., generating prime numbers), a generator can produce them indefinitely without exhausting memory.
Clean syntax: It can provide a more concise and Pythonic way to express lazy evaluation compared to explicit yield statements within a regular function.

# In summary:

While all three approaches produce the same output (a list of doubled values), they differ in their efficiency and style. doubleL(n) is straightforward but creates a list that might not be necessary if memory is a concern. The list comprehension in Approach 2 is concise but less generalizable. doubleG(n) is a generator function that offers memory efficiency and can be particularly beneficial for large datasets or infinite sequences.
